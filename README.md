# Weather APP
https://joriordan332.github.io/weather-app/

This is weather app that shows the current weather forecast of the location of the users choosing. The default location is Acklam which is my location but the user can search anywhere in the world and it will display numerous features about the weather such as chance of rain, sunrise and sunset etc.

The weather app helped consolidate the previous lessons I have read on the odin project around the use of asynchronous code and APIs. With this project I fetch weather API info from https://www.weatherapi.com/ process the JSON data with functions and return an object with all of the data which I wanted for the app. Other similar projects chose to display the weather through changing the background to represent the weather at that location. I chose to do it through a weather icon from the API so that could be something I could try to implement in future. 

To use the app the user has to enter a valid location and then either click the magnifying glass or enter on the keyboard. The user can also click on the celcius or fahrenheit button depending on their preference to display the temperature in that format.
